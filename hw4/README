ECE 571 Spring 2015 HW4
Paul Long <paul@thelongs.ws>

To demo the homework, type "make run" from the command line.
This will run the exhaustive test, dumping output to screen and
HW4.log either of which may be inspected to verify proper operation
of the machine.
If you would like to interactively select the ticket price for the machine
from a subset of valid ticket prices, type "make runP" on the command line. 
The logfile will be named HW4_P<$PRICE>.log where <$PRICE> is the price you select.

Design Assumptions:
  There is an external controller responsible for generating valid inputs.
  Inputs will never be asserted at the same time.
  Inputs will only be asserted when either the Bill or Ready signals are also asserted.
  Inputs should only be asserted for one clock cycle at a time.
  Output signals need only be asserted for one clock cycle.

Verification Assumptions:
  Verification will be done by inspection of the output tables.
  State traversal is displayed after each test, a missing state is not necessarily an error,
  for example if no change is required--a valid outcome--the ReturnTen state will never be hit.
